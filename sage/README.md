# The "Sage" Theme

To build it, you have to run `make`.
Since it uses [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) to build the CSS,
you need to install it in a recent version, e.g.:

    $ gem install --user-install sass

This requires `ruby` and here is the
[SASS documentation](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#css_extensions)
